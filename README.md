# PROBLEM STATEMENT
In today's rapidly evolving financial landscape, where globalization and technological advancements have brought unprecedented opportunities, there's a dark underbelly that cannot be ignored. The staggering $2 trillion in global money laundering annually is not just a statistic; it's a stark reminder of the challenges financial institutions face. On top of this, the immense cost, roughly $900 million to $1.3 billion per year, that banks bear to navigate the complex terrain of Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance is a burden that cannot be understated. Furthermore, the cumbersome and manual nature of compliance processes not only strains financial institutions but also hampers the efficiency and relationships they build with their clients.
